  <h3>Connection between status conferences and prosecutorial actions</h3>
  <p>
    As soon as my Superior Court status conference was scheduled to address why I could not retrieve my property despite valid court orders (10/30/2024), Brett Rigg resurrected previously vacated allegations (10/22/2024). This timing directly obstructed enforcement of property retrieval and shifted focus back to criminal allegations, preventing compliance with the judge’s orders.

    <!-- 1. Case Summary -->
    <section id="casesummary">
      <h2>Case Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This case involves a series of disputes, court proceedings, and enforcement issues arising from my separation with my ex-partner. The matters span multiple courts, judges, and agencies, and include both civil and criminal components. Key issues include enforcement of court orders, ownership of animals, property disputes, defamation, and allegations made against me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orders for Protection (OFP):</strong> I was granted an OFP with law enforcement standby. Despite this, violations occurred without judicial enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Minute Orders:</strong> Judge Butch Gunnels initially authorized retrieval of my dogs and lifted Brady restrictions, but later reversed his decision without legal reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Law Enforcement Non-Compliance:</strong> Sheriffs and constables refused to enforce court orders, citing need for County Attorney approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Trial and Trial:</strong> The vacated case was reopened, leading to misdemeanor charges prosecuted by Brett Rigg. Evidence lacking metadata and integrity was admitted, and Judge Jay Yellowhorse presided after Judge Gunnels was unavailable.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeals and Complaints:</strong> I filed complaints against multiple judges for misconduct and appealed rulings. Judge Whiting struck motions from the record, and Brett Rigg attempted to exclude medical evidence of injuries sustained from my ex’s assault.</li>
        <li><strong>Defamation:</strong> My ex published defamatory posts and videos on Facebook, which remain publicly accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Animal Ownership:</strong> Disputes over my Doberman Zelda and her litters resulted in financial losses and welfare concerns, with my ex selling litters without sharing proceeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Civil Lawsuit:</strong> In September 2024, my ex filed a lawsuit alleging sex trafficking, rape, and attempted murder, demanding $50,000 and property transfer. The judge dismissed the lawsuit.</li>
        <li><strong>Contradictory Testimony:</strong> My ex made inconsistent statements in court and on body camera footage, undermining her credibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> At trial, her only request was that I sign over property to her.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the case reflects repeated contradictions, enforcement failures, and dismissed claims, alongside ongoing disputes over property, animals, and reputation.

    <!-- 2. Court Orders and Outcomes -->
    <section id="courtorders">
      <h2>Court Orders and Outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>At the trial disputing her OFP claims, Judge Butch Gunnels dismissed the charges in a minute order entry, vacating the case. 5/22/2024</li>
        <h2>Minute Entry</h2>
          <li>The judge lifted the Brady restriction. 6/4/2024</li>
        <li>A subsequent minute order entry authorized me to retrieve my dogs with proof of ownership. 6/6/2024</li>
        <li>I had a hearing for my own OFP in Superior Court, which was granted.5/29/2024</li>
        <li>The OFP included a law enforcement standby provision.</li>
        <li>As a result, I now had:
          <ul>
            <li>An OFP granting law enforcement standby. 5/29/2024</li>
            <li>A minute order entry to retrieve my dogs and personal belongings. 6/6/2024</li>
            <li>A minute order entry that the case of her allegations was vacated. 5/22/2024</li>
            <li>The Brady restriction lifted, allowing me to retrieve my firearms from the sheriff’s office. 6/4/2024</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="noncompliance">
      <h2>Non-Compliance with Court Orders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Despite having all the paperwork authorizing retrieval of my dogs, the sheriff refused to take me to the property. The constable also refused.</li>
        <li>The sheriff’s office refused to return my firearms, even after the Brady restriction was lifted.</li>
        <li>Each official cited the same reason: they required approval from the County Attorney before obeying the judge’s orders.</li>
        <li>The County Attorney at the time was Michael Whiting.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Civil Lawsuit -->

    <section id="complaintsappeal">
      <h2>Complaints and Appeal Proceedings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Attorney General’s Office referred me to the Arizona State Bar. The State Bar refused to investigate Brett Rigg, despite his prosecution relying on asymmetrical body camera footage and evidence lacking metadata.</li>
        <li>The Attorney General’s Office also referred me to the Arizona Ombudsman-Citizens’ Aide, but they stated they could not help. They referred me to the Arizona Commission on Judicial Conduct.</li>
        <li>I filed four separate complaints against judges:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Judge Butch Gunnels:</strong> Told me to “shut up” in court and changed his mind without legal reasoning on his minute order entry.</li>
            <li><strong>Judge Robert Higgins:</strong> Failed to address the ranch issue despite stating he would at a status conference on October 30th 2024, and failed to enforce two violations of my OFPs I raised at evidentiary hearing on Dec 4th 2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Judge Jay Yellowhorse:</strong> Allowed unverified evidence (photo without metadata, audio recording of a recording) to proceed to trial.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I filed an appeal. Judge Whiting struck from the record several motions I had filed legally.</li>
        <li>During the appeal, on April 24 2025 Brett Rigg attempted to strike all medical records I submitted, including documentation that I suffer from:
          <ul>
            <li>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) from her assault.</li>
            <li>A bilateral septum break from her punching me.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>In body camera footage, she stated that I would never hurt my animals.</li>
        <li>In court, she claimed that I beat the animals and used this claim as a reason not to return my dogs.</li>
        <li>Despite those claims, in the same court hearing she agreed to give me back the last puppy from one of the litters.</li>

        <li><strong>Arizona: May 8th 2024</strong> Rock thrown at ankle, ER visit, medical boot.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona: May 2024</strong> High-powered flashlight shined into eye.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona: May 2024</strong> The week before, she pulled a loaded 9mm handgun with hollowpoint ammunition.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona:</strong> While out driving for DoorDash, I called her because my ankle was swelling and I needed to go to the hospital. She hung up on me, did not return my calls, and instead went to Bo Hounshell’s house.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant Individuals:</strong> Bo Hounshell is the son of Brian Hounshell (charged with 11 felonies and former detective) and Annelle Hounshell (court clerk).</li>
        <li><strong>Apache County:</strong> The next evening I received a phone call from the Apache County Sheriff’s Office informing me she had been arrested and was in jail with two dogs and the Jeep. Deputies came to my ranch to explain. I recounted the incidents (rock thrown at ankle, gun pulled). They said she had played an audio recording that incriminated her for assault, leading to her arrest. While at the ranch, I offered them water but was standing down the driveway due to my medical boot. I asked for a ride up; they told me to get in the back of their truck. Once inside, they asked for my wallet and phone and then arrested me.</li>

      <h2>Attorney General Involvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I contacted the Attorney General’s Office regarding the ongoing matters.</li>
        <li>This included the issue of Constable Lance Pearce canceling my civil standby permanently via text message.</li>
        <li>Constable Pearce claimed the civil standby was “off” from that point forward.</li>

    <!-- OFP Violations (supporting context) -->
    <section id="ofpviolations">
      <h2>OFP Violations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>August 8, 2024:</strong> My ex came to my apartment in Pinetop, AZ around 9 PM. She was seen by my neighbor in the parking lot near my door. I provided his statement to the court.</li>
        <li><strong>October 16, 2024:</strong> I attempted to retrieve personal belongings with probation officers. My ex was not present at the property. When contacted by phone, she:
          <ul>
            <li>Threatened the probation officers with trespassing charges and arrest.</li>
            <li>Questioned the validity of my papers, claiming they were fake.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This constituted a second violation of the OFP that had been granted to me.</li>
        <li>When I raised these violations in court at the status conference, on December 4 2024 Judge Robert Higgins took no action against her.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>I called the sheriff and explained the situation. He advised me to press charges or file for an order for protection.</li>
        <li>At that time, I did not want to press charges but I did file for an OFP.</li>
        <li>A few days later, while staying at a hotel, I was served by Constable Lance Pearce with an OFP that Mary had filed and received without a trial. 5/28/2024</li>

  <h3>Retaliatory actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mary’s timing:</strong> Her OFP was filed after I had already been cleared (case vacated), indicating retaliation to block property retrieval and influence civil matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Prosecutorial timing:</strong> Brett Rigg refiled allegations only after my status conference was granted, serving them just before the hearing to derail enforcement of court orders.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Political and judicial connections</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Residence:</strong> Mary stayed at Bo Hounshell’s home.</li>
    <li><strong>Court link:</strong> Bo is the son of Superior Court Clerk Annelle Hounshell.</li>
    <li><strong>County attorney ties:</strong> Bo’s father, Brian Hounshell, is friends with County Attorney Michael Whiting (who oversees Prosecutor Brett Rigg).</li>
    <li><strong>Criminal context:</strong> Brian Hounshell was convicted of 11 Felonies and Michael Whiting rehired him later. Apache County Attorney Michael Whiting has been indicted on several felony and misdemeanor counts, including harassment, sending a threatening or anonymous letter, misuse of public monies, theft, conflict of interest, and stealing, destroying, altering, or secreting public records.
 
Mr. Whiting's spouse, Apache County School Superintendent Joyclynn Whiting, was charged with one felony count of misuse of public monies and one felony count of conflict of interest.
 
Mr. Whiting's aide, Daryl Greer, has been indicted on two misdemeanor and two felony counts, including misuse of public monies, harassment, and sending a threatening or anonymous letter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Direct statement</h3>
  <p>
    The sequence and proximity of these actions are not coincidental. Mary filed her OFP after my case was vacated, and Prosecutor Brett Rigg resurrected allegations only once my status conference to enforce court orders was scheduled—serving them just before the hearing. Together, these actions functioned to obstruct enforcement, retaliate against me for asserting my rights, and shift focus away from court‑ordered property retrieval.
