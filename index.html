    <!-- 1. Case Summary -->
    <section id="casesummary">
      <h2>Case Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This case involves a series of disputes, court proceedings, and enforcement issues arising from my separation with my ex-partner. The matters span multiple courts, judges, and agencies, and include both civil and criminal components. Key issues include enforcement of court orders, ownership of animals, property disputes, defamation, and allegations made against me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orders for Protection (OFP):</strong> I was granted an OFP with law enforcement standby. Despite this, violations occurred without judicial enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Minute Orders:</strong> Judge Butch Gunnels initially authorized retrieval of my dogs and lifted Brady restrictions, but later reversed his decision without legal reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Law Enforcement Non-Compliance:</strong> Sheriffs and constables refused to enforce court orders, citing need for County Attorney approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Trial and Trial:</strong> The vacated case was reopened, leading to misdemeanor charges prosecuted by Brett Rigg. Evidence lacking metadata and integrity was admitted, and Judge Jay Yellowhorse presided after Judge Gunnels was unavailable.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeals and Complaints:</strong> I filed complaints against multiple judges for misconduct and appealed rulings. Judge Whiting struck motions from the record, and Brett Rigg attempted to exclude medical evidence of injuries sustained from my ex’s assault.</li>
        <li><strong>Defamation:</strong> My ex published defamatory posts and videos on Facebook, which remain publicly accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Animal Ownership:</strong> Disputes over my Doberman Zelda and her litters resulted in financial losses and welfare concerns, with my ex selling litters without sharing proceeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Civil Lawsuit:</strong> In September 2024, my ex filed a lawsuit alleging sex trafficking, rape, and attempted murder, demanding $50,000 and property transfer. The judge dismissed the lawsuit.</li>
        <li><strong>Contradictory Testimony:</strong> My ex made inconsistent statements in court and on body camera footage, undermining her credibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> At trial, her only request was that I sign over property to her.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the case reflects repeated contradictions, enforcement failures, and dismissed claims, alongside ongoing disputes over property, animals, and reputation.

    <section id="complaintsappeal">
      <h2>Complaints and Appeal Proceedings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Attorney General’s Office referred me to the Arizona State Bar. The State Bar refused to investigate Brett Rigg, despite his prosecution relying on asymmetrical body camera footage and evidence lacking metadata.</li>
        <li>The Attorney General’s Office also referred me to the Arizona Ombudsman-Citizens’ Aide, but they stated they could not help. They referred me to the Arizona Commission on Judicial Conduct.</li>
        <li>I filed four separate complaints against judges:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Judge Butch Gunnels:</strong> Told me to “shut up” in court and changed his mind without legal reasoning on his minute order entry.</li>
            <li><strong>Judge Robert Higgins:</strong> Failed to address the ranch issue despite stating he would at a status conference on October 30th 2024, and failed to enforce two violations of my OFPs I raised at evidentiary hearing on Dec 4th 2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Judge Jay Yellowhorse:</strong> Allowed unverified evidence (photo without metadata, audio recording of a recording) to proceed to trial.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I filed an appeal. Judge Whiting struck from the record several motions I had filed legally.</li>
        <li>During the appeal, on April 24 2025 Brett Rigg attempted to strike all medical records I submitted, including documentation that I suffer from:
          <ul>
            <li>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) from her assault.</li>
            <li>A bilateral septum break from her punching me.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <ul>

      <ul>
        <li>In body camera footage, she stated that I would never hurt my animals.</li>

        <li>Zelda, my Doberman, was 4 years old during our separation and pregnant with her 4th litter.</li>
        <li>I intended to retire her and have her fixed after that litter.</li>
        <li>My ex sold the entire 4th litter, kept all the money, and did not share or send any of it to me, despite me being the business owner.</li>
        <li>She bred Zelda again and sold another litter without my involvement.</li>
        <li>Zelda is now pregnant again with her 6th litter.</li>
        <section id="zelda-photo">

        <li><strong>Los Angeles: Nov 2020</strong> Jaw injury from metal object, cracked tooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona: May 8th 2024</strong> Rock thrown at ankle, ER visit, medical boot.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona: May 2024</strong> High-powered flashlight shined into eye.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona: May 2024</strong> The week before, she pulled a loaded 9mm handgun with hollowpoint ammunition.</li>
        <li><strong>Arizona:</strong> While out driving for DoorDash, I called her because my ankle was swelling and I needed to go to the hospital. She hung up on me, did not return my calls, and instead went to Bo Hounshell’s house.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant Individuals:</strong> Bo Hounshell is the son of Brian Hounshell (charged with 11 felonies and former detective) and Annelle Hounshell (court clerk).</li>
        <li><strong>Apache County:</strong> The next evening I received a phone call from the Apache County Sheriff’s Office informing me she had been arrested and was in jail with two dogs and the Jeep. Deputies came to my ranch to explain. I recounted the incidents (rock thrown at ankle, gun pulled). They said she had played an audio recording that incriminated her for assault, leading to her arrest. While at the ranch, I offered them water but was standing down the driveway due to my medical boot. I asked for a ride up; they told me to get in the back of their truck. Once inside, they asked for my wallet and phone and then arrested me.</li>

        <li>My arrest was recorded, but my testimony was not.</li>

        <li>I was allowed to return home, but a mutual friend warned me she would lie to police and claim I beat her if I went back to the property.</li>
        <li>On the friend’s advice, I avoided returning to the property.</li>
        <li>Without a way to charge my phone, with no money (card declined for insufficient funds), and no shoes, I had to stay in a hotel.</li>
